# Version Control For Game Developers

Slides from the Version Control for Game Developers presentation

## Class Description ##

At some point you or someone on your team will make a mistake. Itâ€™s a question of when, not if.

You probably have heard of verson control, do you think it's more trouble than it's worth? Do you think copy/pasting files into alternate folders at certain milestones is "good enough"? Do you share code with your team through Dropbox or OneDrive? Are you just working on a quick fix/simple prototype, and think putting it in version control would be overkill?

If you answer yes to any of the above questions, this class is for you. This class will explain why version control is important, why it's useful, why it's easier than you may think, and everything you need to know to start using git on all of your projects.

Developers of all skill levels and experience are welcome. From the basics of your first git repo, to advanced concepts that will showcase why proper version control can change your life.
 
**Requirements if you want to follow along:**

- Bring your own laptop (or you won't be able to follow along)!
